This is my parser/interpreter that reads my 'original' code and by parsing it, executes.

The syntax for my code is pretty simple.

Integ-s are integers
Booly-s are bools
Floats are floats(pretty straightforward)
Loops are loops(again)
Conds are traditional if-s(cond stands for condition)
And Print is for printing(output).

You can declare the numbers and do mathematical operations with them, like adding(+),subtracting(-),
muliplying(*),dividing(/ or %).

You can also declare strings by writing a variable and assigning a word(string), which has to 
be enclosed in '(apostrophe) symbols.

In the end of each line you have to enter a ;(semicolon) symbol.
The program even returns errors(if you have started testing the program without reding this file
you already have noticed).

To print basically type print and enter two !(exclamation marks) after the keyword print.

To use loops there are two rules to remember, first one is that the condition has to be 
enclosed in !(exclamation marks), but unlike the print ines, here you need to input only one on each side,
same goes for the if(conds).

The bodies of both loops and conditional have to be enclosed in |(vertical bars).

I think I went through all the rules of my interpreter, go ahead test it, have fun, I am open to any
advices, suggestions and even criticism regarding my projcet. All that is left to say is Have fun!
